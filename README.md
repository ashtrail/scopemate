# ScopeMate

This is quick scope estimation tool, it was mostly thought for game jams but it might come in handy for other kinds of projects too.

ScopeMate serves two major purposes :

- Avoid overlooking the real quantity of work (in time) required by a feature or by the fact of multiplying it (for instance adding a second playable character)
- Have a better idea of the work load by discipline. For example if you are working on a project with a programmer and an artist you should aim for a 50-50 repartition of work (so ~50% of the work required should be graphical and the other ~50% development). With this tool you can avoid laying a disproportionate amount of the work load on the different members of the team by adjusting the scope of the game thanks to estimations.

The intended use is to estimate the scope of a project idea and adjust it if it seems unbalanced. You can also check the time gain of different approaches. For example if making a colored sprite takes you an hour and making a black and white one takes you only thirty minutes, you can check how much time you would gain or lose on the entire project depending on which option you choose.

## Usage

This tiny library requires Node.js to work.

Here's an example that shows everything that can be done with ScopeMate (for the moment at least). This example is just meant as an inspiration and doesn't represent a realistic project.

Copy paste the following code in a `main.js` file and put `scopemate.js` in the same folder.

```
const { Task, Requirement, getProjectStats } = require('./scopemate')

const portrait = new Task('Portrait', 'Art', 60)
const sprite = new Task('Sprite', 'Art', 60)
const gameBackground = new Task('Game Background', 'Art', 10)

const endGameScreen = new Task('End Game Screen', 'Code', 15)

const bgmTrack = new Task('BGM Track', 'Music', 120)

const endScreen = new Requirement()
endScreen.add(gameBackground, 1)
endScreen.add(endGameScreen, 1)

const character = new Requirement()
character.add(portrait, 2) // win, lose
character.add(sprite, 1)

const game = new Requirement()
game.add(character, 2) // player, boss
game.add(bgmTrack, 3) // game, lose, win
game.add(endScreen, 2) // lose, win

console.log(JSON.stringify(getProjectStats(game), null, 2))
```

```
